## 2. Introduction
- Background: ABC Corporation requested a comprehensive security audit to assess its current security measures and identify potential vulnerabilities. The audit was conducted over a two-week period.
- Audit Scope
    - The audit included:
        - Network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls)
        - Servers (web, database, file servers)
        - Web applications (customer portal, internal tools)
        - Endpoint devices (desktops, laptops, mobile devices)
        - Security policies and procedures
- Objectives
    - Identify and assess vulnerabilities
    - Evaluate security configurations and practices
    - Provide actionable recommendations
- Standards and Frameworks
    - OWASP Top Ten
    - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
    - ISO/IEC 27001

## 3. Methodology
- Approach: The audit used a combination of black-box and white-box testing methods to simulate external and internal threats.
- Tools
    - Nmap: Network discovery and port scanning
    - Nessus: Vulnerability scanning
    - Metasploit: Exploitation framework
    - Burp Suite: Web application security testing
    - Wireshark: Network protocol analysis
- Procedures
    - Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the network and systems
    - Scanning: Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities
    - Exploitation: Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities
    - Post-Exploitation: Assessing the potential impact and extracting data
    - Reporting: Documenting findings and recommendations

## 4. Findings
- Summary Table
- Detailed Findings
    - F-001: SQL Injection
        - Description: The customer portal is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries.
        - Impact: Potential unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.
        - Evidence: Exploitation via ' OR '1'='1 payload.
        - Risk Level: High
        - Recommended Action: Implement input validation and use parameterized queries.

## 5. Recommendations
- Prioritized Actions
- Detailed Steps
- Resources
- Example:
    - Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication
    - Steps:
        - Implement MFA for all critical systems and user accounts.
        - Use MFA solutions that support various authentication methods (e.g., SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens).
        - Regularly review and update MFA configurations.
        - Reference: NIST SP 800-63B Authentication Guidelines

## 6. Conclusion
- Overall Assessment: ABC Corporation has several critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the organization’s security posture.
- Improvements
    - Implementing the recommended actions will reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
    - Regular security training and awareness programs will help maintain a strong security culture.
- Next Steps
    - Address high-priority vulnerabilities immediately.
    - Schedule follow-up audits to ensure remediation efforts are effective.
    - Implement continuous monitoring to detect and respond to new threats promptly.

## 1. Methodology
- Testing and vulnerability rankings are based on NIST 800-30 threat rankings methodology. 

### Threat Likelihood
- High: A threat actor is highly likely to create an event
- Moderate: A threat actor is likely to create an event
- Low: A threat actor is unlikely to create an event

### Threat Impact
- Critical: The event would have a catastrophically negative impact on the organization.
- High: The event would have a severe negative impact on the organization.
- Moderate: The event would have a negative impact on the organization.
- Low: The event would have a limited negative impact on the organization.
- Informational: The event would have a negligible impact on the organization.

### Level of Risk: Likelihood x Impact
- Critical: The event would have multiple severe or catastrophic negative effects on the organization.
- High: The event would have a catastrophic negative effect on the organization.
- Moderate: The event would have a negative effect on the organization.
- Low: The event would have a limited negative impact on the organization
- Informational: The event would have a negligible impact on the organization.

## Scope
- The assessment was performed with the following targets in scope:
    - http://www.my-application.com:8080
    - https://www.st-my-application.com
    - https://www.prod1.my-application.com

## Executive Summary
The assessment team conducted a penetration test for “Your Company” from October 10 – October 15, 2020. This test was designed to provide “Your Company” with an assessment of your web application from the perspective of a malicious external 3rd party.

## Synopsis
The assessment team discovered several vulnerabilities including cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and denial of service.

## Finding and Recommendations
- UNAUTHENTICATED SQL INJECTION – CRITICAL
- Cross-Site Scripting: A SQL injection attack consists of the insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands.

- Details
    - The assessment team identified a SQL Injection attack on the login page of your application. The team was able to successfully exploit this vulnerability to bypass authentication and access restricted pages.
    - This was discovered on:
        - https://www.my-application.com

- Recommendations:To address the SQL injections issues, the assessment team recommends:
    - Using parameterized queries when executing SQL with user input
    - Only allow expected inputs
