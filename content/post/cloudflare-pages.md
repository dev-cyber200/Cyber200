## How Does Cloudflare Pages Work?
Getting started with Cloudflare Pages is straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide to deploy your first static site:

1. Create a GitHub Repository:
- Create a new repository on GitHub for your static site or use an existing one.

2. Set Up Your Static Site:

- Initialize your static site using your preferred static site generator (e.g., Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js). Ensure your site is ready for deployment.

3. Connect to Cloudflare Pages:

- Sign in to your Cloudflare account (or create one if you don’t have one).
- Navigate to the Cloudflare Pages dashboard.
- Click on “Create a project” and connect your GitHub account.
- Select the repository you want to deploy.
4. Configure the Build Settings:

- Specify the build settings, including the build command and the directory where the static files are generated (e.g., public for Hugo, out for Next.js).
- Set up environment variables if needed for your build process.
5. Deploy Your Site:

- Cloudflare Pages will automatically trigger a build and deployment for your site.
- Once the deployment is complete, you’ll receive a unique URL where your site is live.
- Optionally, configure a custom domain and set up DNS records through Cloudflare for your custom domain.
6. Continuous Deployment:

- Every push to your GitHub repository triggers a new deployment, ensuring that your site is always up to date with the latest changes.
