### Tools and Techniques for Risk Evaluation
- Risk Matrix: A visual tool that plots risks on a grid based on their likelihood and impact.
- SWOT Analysis: Identifies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to risks.
- Monte Carlo Simulation: A quantitative technique that uses probability distributions to model and analyze the impact of risks.
- Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA): Identifies potential failure modes within a system and their impact.


#### Risk Formula
- Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact
- Likelihood = Threat x Vulnerability
- Risk = Likelihood x Impact
- Impact - Measures the consequence of a successful attack.

#### Risk Matrix
Impact\Likelihood |	Very Low |	Low	| Medium | High | Very High
---|---|---|---|---|---
Very Low |	Trivial |	Minor |	Minor |	Major | Critical
Low	| Minor | Minor | Major | Major | Critical
Medium |	Minor	| Major	| Major	| Critical	| Catastrophic
High	| Major	| Major	| Critical |	Catastrophic |	Catastrophic
Very High	| Major | Critical| Catastrophic| Catastrophic	| Catastrophi

### Threat Model Frameworks
- STRIDE
- DREAD
- PASTA
- VAST
- NIST

##### STRIDE
- Spoofing - Spoofing occurs when someone masquerades as a person or system they are not.
- Tampering - Someone alters data
- Repudiation - The ability to deny something
- Information Disclosure - Threat of leaking privileged or sensitive information
- Denial of Service - Aims to render a service or system unusable
- Elevation of Privilege - A user performs actions not intended for their level of permissions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Context
- Threat Models: The process for identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities, evaluating the risk, determining mitigations for such threats, and prioritizing any mitigations or fixes to the system.
- Vulnerability: It is a weakness in a system or software that can be exploited to make a system behave in an unintended way.

- Threat: A threat is a hypothetical event wherein an attacker could use (or exploit) a vulnerability.

- Asset Valuation: asset - An asset in the context of information security is anything of value to a business that is related to information systems.

- Mitigation and Prioritizing Risk: mitigation is an action taken to reduce the risk of a given threat.
