## Network Security
- Firewalls: Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks. They monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
    - Types: Packet-filtering firewalls, Stateful inspection firewalls, Proxy firewalls, Next-generation firewalls (NGFW).
- Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): These systems monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and can take action to prevent potential threats.
    - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Detect and alert on suspicious activity.
    - Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): Detect and block suspicious activity.
- Network Segmentation: Dividing a network into smaller segments or subnetworks to limit the impact of a breach and improve security management.
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Secure connections over public networks by encrypting the data transmitted between devices and networks.

## Endpoint Security
- Antivirus and Anti-malware Software: Programs that detect, prevent, and remove malicious software from endpoints like computers and mobile devices.
    - Heuristic Analysis: Identifies new, unknown viruses by examining code behavior.
    - Signature-Based Detection: Matches files against a database of known malware signatures.
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Tools that provide real-time monitoring and response capabilities for endpoint devices.
    - Features: Continuous monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and data collection for analysis.
- Patch Management: Regularly updating software and systems to fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

## Access Control
- Authentication: Verifying the identity of users before granting access to systems.
    - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Requires two or more forms of verification, such as a password and a fingerprint.

- Authorization: Granting or denying permissions to users based on their identity and roles.
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigns permissions based on user roles within an organization.

- Least Privilege Principle: Ensuring users have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.

## Data Protection
- Encryption: Converting data into a coded format that can only be read by authorized parties.

    - Types: Symmetric encryption (same key for encryption and decryption), Asymmetric encryption (public and private keys).
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Techniques and tools designed to prevent data breaches by monitoring and controlling data transfers.
    - Features: Content discovery, data classification, policy enforcement.
- Backups: Regularly creating copies of data to restore in case of data loss or corruption.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Log Management: Collecting and analyzing log data from various sources to identify and respond to security incidents.
    - Features: Centralized logging, real-time monitoring, historical analysis.

- Correlation and Analysis: Using correlation rules to detect patterns and anomalies that indicate potential security threats.

- Incident Response: Procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.

## User Training and Awareness
- Security Awareness Training: Educating employees about cybersecurity best practices and how to recognize common threats like phishing.
    - Topics: Password security, email safety, social engineering, data protection.

- Simulated Phishing Attacks: Testing employees' ability to recognize and respond to phishing attempts through controlled simulations.

## Application Security
- Secure Coding Practices: Writing code with security in mind to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
    - Techniques: Input validation, output encoding, error handling.

- Application Security Testing: Identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in applications through various testing methods.
    - Types: Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST).
- Web Application Firewalls (WAFs): Protecting web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic.

## Physical Security
- Access Control Systems: Controlling physical access to facilities using methods like keycards, biometrics, and security guards.

- Surveillance: Monitoring facilities with cameras and other surveillance equipment to detect and respond to unauthorized access.

- Environmental Controls: Protecting data centers and critical infrastructure from environmental hazards like fire, flooding, and power outages.
