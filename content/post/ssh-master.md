## Overview

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote systems over an unsecured network, It was designed to replace earlier insecure protocols such as Telnet, rlogin, and FTP by providing a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a client-server architecture, encryption, and authentication mechanisms.

##### Key Components of SSH
1. SSH Client: The program that initiates the connection to the SSH server. Common SSH clients include OpenSSH, PuTTY, and SecureCRT.
2. SSH Server: The program running on the remote machine that listens for incoming SSH connections. The server component is usually called sshd (SSH Daemon).

## How SSH Works

1. Establishing the Connection
When an SSH client initiates a connection to an SSH server, the following steps occur:

- Connection Establishment:

    - The client connects to the server using TCP on the default port 22 (this can be configured to use a different port).

- Handshake and Key Exchange:

    - The client and server exchange identification data to agree on the SSH protocol version and supported encryption algorithms.
    - They perform a key exchange (commonly using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm) to securely generate a shared secret key used for encrypting the session.

2. Authentication
After the secure channel is established, the client needs to authenticate itself to the server. SSH supports multiple authentication methods:

- Password Authentication:

    - The client sends a username and password to the server.
    - The server checks the credentials and grants or denies access.

- Public Key Authentication:

    - The client generates a key pair (public and private keys).
    - The public key is added to the serverâ€™s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
    - During authentication, the client proves it has the corresponding private key without sending it over the network.
    - The server challenges the client with a message encrypted with the public key. The client must decrypt it with the private key and send back the original message to authenticate.

3. Other Methods:

    - SSH also supports other methods like Kerberos, GSSAPI, and certificate-based authentication.

## Secure Data Transmission
Once authentication is successful, the SSH session begins. All data transmitted between the client and the server is encrypted using the session key established during the handshake.

- Data Encryption:
    - SSH uses symmetric encryption (e.g., AES, ChaCha20) for encrypting the data.
    - This ensures that any data sent over the network is unreadable to anyone who intercepts it.

- Integrity Verification:

    - SSH uses message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure data integrity.
    - This verifies that the data has not been altered during transmission.
- Compression (optional):

    - SSH can optionally compress data before transmitting it to reduce bandwidth usage.

## Advanced Features of SSH
* Port Forwarding:
    * SSH can tunnel other network connections through the secure SSH connection.
    * Local Port Forwarding: Redirects traffic from a local port to a remote address via the SSH server. 
        * It forwards a port from your local machine to a remote server. This can be useful for accessing services on a remote server as if they were running on your local machine.
        * Example Scenario:
        * You want to access a web application running on port 8080 on a remote server (remote.example.com) from your local machine on port 8080.
        ```sh
        ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@remote.example.com
        ```
        * L: Specifies local port forwarding.
        * 8080:localhost:8080: Redirects traffic from localhost:8080 on your local machine to localhost:8080 on the remote server.
        * user@remote.example.com: Your SSH login credentials for the remote server.

    - Remote Port Forwarding: Redirects traffic from a remote port to a local address via the SSH client.
    - Dynamic Port Forwarding: Uses SOCKS proxy to dynamically forward traffic to various destinations.
- X11 Forwarding:

    - SSH can securely forward X11 graphical applications from a remote server to the local client.
- SSH Agent Forwarding:

    - SSH agent stores private keys and can forward authentication requests to avoid repeatedly entering passphrases.
- File Transfers:
    - SCP (Secure Copy Protocol): Transfers files between hosts over an SSH connection.
    - SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol): Provides file access, transfer, and management over an SSH connection.
